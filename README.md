The fundamental survey revealed that **68.5%** of the sample of respondents (54 people) used to participate in face-to-face events such as congresses, lectures and the like before the current *COVID-19* pandemic. Demonstrating that **61.1%** of people who attend face-to-face events have already participated online, that is, there is a margin of **95%** in an opportunity for the business conceived during the ideation phase. Challenges such as: Ensuring that participants reach, in online events, the same level of experience as in-person events; Establish a solid connection between participants and speakers; Create links through online chat. Therefore, it is necessary to create technologies that guarantee engagement between participants and speakers. They motivated the creation of an online event platform with dynamic navigation for the user to interact with different simultaneous lectures, as well as the creation of a chat categorized by specific subjects. The proposed solutions highlight a perspective centered on user satisfaction, which aims to achieve greater interactivity in online events. It even allows online ticket sales platforms to reinvent themselves since the ticket purchase.

# THE CHALLENGE

### PEGN e Época Negócios

<img src="https://eventsmaker.jusblog.com/assets/images/side-image.png" alt="PEGN e Época Negócios" />

Our team, motivated by the premise: “how to provide the engaging experience that a face-to-face event provides to its creators in the virtual environment?”, We developed the Events Maker solution to expand the connection between speakers and event participants.

In this way, the participants of an online event will be able to navigate between lectures with just one click, leaving room for dynamic management of simultaneous lectures. In addition, exclusive chat rooms predefined by the organizers, or by users, are categorized by topics of interest.

# FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH

### Who are our personas?

Our survey revealed that **61.1%** of people who attend face-to-face events have participated in them online, noting the **95%** margin in business opportunities.

Results about the question: "[...] how would you like to interact with an online event?" guided the team's claims. To extract value from this information, context analysis was used as a word cloud, considering the number of occurrences of these words greater than twice, as well as isolating irrelevant conjunctions.

Therefore, the highlighted words were: "participants", "would like", "chat", "interaction", "online", "live", suggesting that participants would like an interactive chat during online lives.

<img src="https://eventsmaker.jusblog.com/assets/images/ux/goals/word-cloud-1.png" alt="Events Maker - Word Cloud" />

Therefore, it was concluded, about online events, that most people experience connection problems and do not like the unforeseen technical issues that may arise during the transmission. In addition, 13.2% of the people interviewed recognize the need for specific features for the full inclusion of people with disabilities in broadcasts.

Although **53.7%** of people answered that they do not use the chat to interact with other people during the live at an event, when asked: “if you do not use the chat during a live or event, please tell us why? ”, Considering the context analysis as a word cloud, using the same criteria as above, we reached the following highlighted words:“ no ”,“ attention ”,“ messages ”,“ same ”,“ time ”,“ people ”,“ chat ”, suggesting that people do not use chat due to the amount of messages at the same time, due to the messy conversation aspect, demonstrating the viability of reinventing this functionality.

<img src="https://eventsmaker.jusblog.com/assets/images/ux/goals/word-cloud-2.png" alt="Events Maker - Word Cloud" />

Our survey revealed that **87%** of people would like to participate in online events from the comfort of their home or anywhere else.

When asked what to do to make the experience of the people who participate in these online events unique, considering their opinion, by analyzing the context as a word cloud, using the same patterns mentioned above, we reached the following highlighted words: “ event "," quality "," participants "," connection "," interaction "," video ", suggesting that participants seek quality events for interactive connections with the video (broadcast).

Therefore, we conclude that people seek interactive experience, share opinions on whether or not to use chat during the presentations of the speakers, but recognize the importance of creating connections in online events.

## Problem Analysis

The survey was sent via social networks and multiplatform instant messaging and voice calls to smartphones. In order to identify problems related to the experience of people who used to attend face-to-face events such as congresses, lectures and the like before the current coronavirus pandemic.

To solve the problem, we propose the creation of engaging features that provide dynamic interaction between the speakers and the event participants.

> I find it interesting to put a filter mechanism and, at a specific point in the event, the artist stops this event and makes this interaction with the public. I believe that video interaction is the best alternative. — Cássio Filho, interviewed.

# DEFINING THE PRODUCT

### What exactly are we doing to solve the problem?

<img src="https://eventsmaker.jusblog.com/assets/images/ux/goals/dp/defining-the-product.png" alt="Events Maker - Successful people network." />

Now that we understand our users' desires better, we are able to define the problem to develop the solution.

Therefore, we use a user history map to guide the creation of the functional prototype focused on the features that offer the best experiences for our users.

As main functions, we have:

* Dynamic user navigation between simultaneous lectures;
* Chat interaction categorized by specific events and subjects.

In view of the fundamental research, the user-centered **information architecture** was created in view of its interactivity with the essential functionalities of the functional prototype.

# DESIGN

# WIREFRAME

### What are the ways in which we can solve the problem?

The wireframe was designed to offer the best user experience to the user, in addition to the traditional interactive chat functionality via messages, participatory viewing in lectures with just one click was also considered.

# TEST, TEST AND TEST...

### Usability

The tests conducted in this project had face-to-face approaches characterized by informality with coworkers and family members.

The guiding metrics for UI Design, and especially for the completion of Interaction Design, were about the occurrence of observed problems and spontaneous comments, as well as the success rate in the tasks.

The task was to encourage the interviewee to interact with hand-drawn wireframes (very ugly) to define the most comfortable task flow to follow. In this way, it was possible to validate features such as:

* The real-time change of the reduced size video lecture at the top of the right menu in the chat box;
* The possibility to follow the lecture without losing the interaction of messages in real time in the chat;
* Ensure that speakers reach users through the connection via system functionality;
* Ensure full coverage of the event in the online environment.

In view of this, we were able to project more of the user experience in the final product, despite some contrasts with the initial ideation of the usability flow defined by the team.

# INTERACTION DESIGN

Specific points that guarantee the fluidity of interaction by the application user deserve special attention.

In this sense, considering that **53.7%** of respondents who participate in online events do not use chat for different reasons, it is estimated that this functionality, when active, allows free user interaction with the lectures in a specific menu. for real-time selection.

# UI DESIGN

### How do we give our users a remarkable experience?

The guarantee of a fluid connection between the lectures and interactivity between the participants were one of the main aspects of this project. The dark theme contrasted with warm colors, such as red, for the action buttons, and cool colors, such as purple and blue, encourage the user to interact with excitement and attention. According to the Material Design website (Dark Theme), in free translation, “dark themes reduce the luminosity emitted by the device's screens, while still reaching the minimum color contrast rates. They help to improve visual ergonomics, reducing eye fatigue, adjusting brightness to current lighting conditions and making it easier to use the screen in dark environments - all while saving your battery power ".

# RESULTS

### Final considerations

I experienced an extremely exciting journey participating in Shawee's Hackathon Mega Hack 2.0 as UX Designer.

Coordinating interviews and proposing solutions motivated by user satisfaction, aiming at emotion and involvement, was a sensational experience.

As a programmer, I have always recognized the importance of ensuring the satisfaction of the user experience, however, there was no active participation in this “strategic analysis” so relevant and guiding.

I am sure that if our team was not assembled in the context of a hackathon, everything we propose and managed to validate would give rise to a functional prototype with all the idealized purposes.
